# ⚓ Battle Ships Crews

FullStack Project – Battleship game in PHP & MySQL

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Battle Ships Crews** is a two-player web-based battleship game. Each player places their ships on a grid and then takes turns firing shots to sink the opponent’s fleet. The game relies on a **FullStack architecture**, with server-side game logic and an interactive web interface.

The project was initially designed to be developed in pairs, but it was ultimately completed entirely independently.
